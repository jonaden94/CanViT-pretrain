"""Task-agnostic joint-policy builder for the unified harness (design §7 D-D crown jewel).

Generalizes ``train/joint.py::build_joint_policy`` (which hardwired the distill case:
the core model IS the canvit, INTRINSIC feature groups, no probe) to ANY task by
splitting two roles that distill happened to conflate:

  * ``canvit``       — the recurrent backbone; its ``.cfg`` gives canvas_dim + patcher_name.
  * ``encode_model`` — what the ``StateEncoder`` featurizes: an object exposing ``.canvit``
                       (and, for probe-entropy feature groups, ``.head``). For distill this
                       is ``SimpleNamespace(canvit=canvit)``; for ade20k/in1k it is the task
                       wrapper (``seg`` / ``clf``) so probe-aware features can reach the head.
  * ``feature_groups`` — the task's scorer features (``Task.policy_feature_groups()``):
                       INTRINSIC for distill/in1k, the full set (with ent/ent_delta) for the
                       spatial segmentation probe in ade20k.

Reuses the existing :class:`JointPolicy` container, objectives, selectors and scorer —
this only rewires the encoder so joint task+policy works for all three tasks (distill
already worked; this unlocks ade20k/in1k). The old ``build_joint_policy`` stays until
the big-bang cutover.
