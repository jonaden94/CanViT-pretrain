"""Distill task — the DINOv3 feature-regression peer (design §3.1, §0 table).

Engine-facing core only (the per-batch :class:`RolloutTask` the rollout engine
consumes). Distill's readout is special: its recon/CLS heads live INSIDE the
pretraining forward, so ``forward_glimpse`` IS the model forward and ``step_loss``/
``per_image_loss`` delegate straight to the historical ``DistillTask`` (train/task.py).
This is the exact adapter proven byte-for-byte against the parity digest
``9a0100a1a3de3acd`` in ``harness/tests/test_rollout_parity.py``.

The run-level ``Task`` wrapper (build_model/build_loaders/evaluate) is added with the
neutral loop (design §11); its data pipeline is distill's existing webdataset +
normalizer machinery, unchanged.
